Fast Parameter Inference in a Biomechanical Model of the Left Ventricle using Statistical Emulation.

## Instructions for use

There are two methods compared in the paper: the Local GP Method and the Low-Rank GP Method.
The code for these methods can be found in the folders called **method-localgp** (MATLAB code) and 
**method-low-rank-gps** (R code) respectively, with each folder containing a README file to explain 
how to use the code.

The simulated data is available at `\method-localgp\Simulations\Design4D`, while the data for the healthy
volunteer is available at `\method-localgp\Data\Stacked\DataHV.mat`. The first column of the files
`YTrain4D*`, `YTest4D*`, and `DataHV.mat` contains the LV chamber volume measurement, 
while the remaining columns represent the 24 strain measurements.
