Davies, V., No√®, U., Lazarus, A., Gao, H., Macdonald, B., Berry, C., Luo, X. and Husmeier, D. (2019). Fast Parameter Inference in a Biomechanical Model of the Left Ventricle using Statistical Emulation. Accepted, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society - Series C.

# Instructions for use

There are two methods used in the paper: the Local GP Method and the Low-Rank GP Method. The code for these methods can be found the folders called 'method-localgp' (MATLAB code) and 'method-low-rank-gps' (R code) respectively, with each folder containing a README file to explain how to use the code.

The simulated data is available at \method-localgp\Simulations\Design4D and data for an example left ventricle is available at \method-localgp
